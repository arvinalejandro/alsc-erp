Per agent, different quota (And grouped quota)

backout % : without refund

Old scheme: will start on down payment (payment terms/10)
    - Example: 30 months = every 3 months DP payment = 10% commission
    - (double check old scheme)
    
New scheme: 
10% TCP = 10% commission (RA)
20% TCP = 10% comm (RA, CTS)
70% TCP = 50% comm (RA, CTS)
100% TCP = 30% balance comm

Sales Performance: % accomplishment of quota
